## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (due to dependencies like `google-auth`)
- A Telegram bot token (obtained from [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather))
- Google Cloud Project credentials (`credentials.json`) for Google Sheets integration (see [Google Cloud Setup](#google-cloud-setup))
- `ngrok` (optional, for local development web timer access): [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/)

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/focus-pomodoro-bot
    cd focus-pomodoro-bot
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This installs all required packages including `python-telegram-bot`, `Flask`, `Flask-Babel`, and `python-i18n` for localization.
3.  **Google Cloud Setup (for Sheets Export):**
    - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    - Create a new project (or use an existing one).
    - Enable the "Google Sheets API".
    - Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID credentials (Type: Desktop App).
    - Download the credentials JSON file and save it as `credentials.json` in the root directory of this project.
4.  Create a `.env` file from the example:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
5.  Edit the `.env` file and fill in your details:
    ```plaintext
    # Mandatory
    BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here
    DOMAIN_URL=https://your-domain-or-ngrok-url.com # For web timer link
    ADMIN_USER_ID=your_telegram_user_id # Your numeric Telegram ID for admin features

    # Optional (defaults are usually fine)
    FLASK_PORT=5002
    ```
    - **`BOT_TOKEN`**: Your Telegram bot token from BotFather.
    - **`DOMAIN_URL`**: The publicly accessible URL where the Flask web app (for the timer view) will run. For local development, use your `ngrok` HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://xxxx-xxxx-xxxx.ngrok-free.app`).
    - **`ADMIN_USER_ID`**: Your *numeric* Telegram User ID. You can get this from bots like `@userinfobot`. This user will receive notifications.
    - **`FLASK_PORT`**: The local port the Flask app will listen on (must match ngrok if used).

### Running the Bot

1.  (If using ngrok for local development) Start ngrok:
    ```bash
    ngrok http 5002
    ```
    Make sure the HTTPS URL from ngrok is set as `DOMAIN_URL` in your `.env` file.

2.  Start the bot:
    ```bash
    python bot.py
    ```
    The bot will automatically check and create/update the `focus_pomodoro.db` SQLite database file on startup.

### Internationalization (i18n)

The bot supports multiple languages (currently English, German, and Russian) through a YAML-based translation system:

1. **Bot Interface**: Uses the python-i18n library with translations stored in `locales/*.yml` files.
2. **Web Interface**: The timer web app uses the same translations, integrated with Flask via a custom context processor.
3. **User Preferences**: Users can change their language with the `/language` command, which is remembered and used for all interactions, including the web timer.
4. **Adding Languages**: To add a new language:
   - Create a new `locales/[language_code].yml` file based on the existing ones
   - Add the language code to `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` in `config.py`

**Important:** Ensure `credentials.json` and `.env` are added to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing sensitive information.
