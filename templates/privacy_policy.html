        <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>Google OAuth 2.0 tokens are stored in this database. We take reasonable measures to protect this information, but please note that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.</li>
            <li>The `credentials.json` file, containing Google Cloud client secrets, is stored on the server and is essential for the OAuth flow. It is not directly accessible to users.</li>

            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).</li>

        <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
